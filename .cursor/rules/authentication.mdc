# Authentication Guide

This application uses JWT-based authentication with role-based access control.

## Key Components
- [src/auth/auth.module.ts](mdc:src/auth/auth.module.ts): Authentication module
- [src/common/guards/jwt-auth.guard.ts](mdc:src/common/guards/jwt-auth.guard.ts): JWT Authentication guard
- [src/common/guards/roles.guard.ts](mdc:src/common/guards/roles.guard.ts): Role-based authorization guard

## Authentication Flow
1. Users register or login to receive JWT tokens
2. JWT tokens are stored as HTTP-only cookies
3. The JwtAuthGuard validates tokens on protected endpoints
4. The RolesGuard checks user permissions for specific endpoints

## Protecting Routes
Routes are protected using the JwtAuthGuard and RolesGuard, which are applied globally in [src/main.ts](mdc:src/main.ts).
Specific routes can be excluded from authentication using decorators.
