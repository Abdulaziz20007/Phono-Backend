## Core Models
- **User**: End user accounts with authentication
- **Admin**: Administrator accounts
- **Product**: Main product listings
- **Brand**: Product brands
- **Model**: Product models linked to brands
- **Color**: Product color options
- **Currency**: Currency types and exchange rates
- **Address**: User address information
- **Phone**: User phone contact information
- **Email**: User email addresses
- **Payment**: Payment transactions
- **PaymentMethod**: Available payment methods
- **Comment**: Product comments and reviews
- **FavouriteItem**: User's favorite products
- **Block**: User blocks/bans by admins
- **Otp**: One-time passwords for verification

## Relationships
The schema includes various relationships between models:
- One-to-many (e.g., User to Products)
- Many-to-many (e.g., Users to FavouriteItems)
- One-to-one relationships

## Prisma Service
Database operations are performed through the Prisma service defined in [src/prisma/prisma.service.ts](mdc:src/prisma/prisma.service.ts).
