# Code Organization Guide

## Module Organization
Modules are organized by feature following NestJS conventions:
- Each module has its own directory in the `src/` folder
- Related functionality is grouped together within modules
- Common/shared code is placed in the `src/common/` directory

## File Naming Conventions
- Files are named using kebab-case
- File names include their type (e.g., `.controller.ts`, `.service.ts`, `.module.ts`)
- DTOs are organized in a `dto/` folder within each module
- Interfaces and types should use `.interface.ts` and `.type.ts` suffixes

## Import Organization
Imports should be organized in the following order:
1. External libraries and frameworks (e.g., NestJS)
2. Internal modules and services
3. Local imports (from same directory)
4. Interface and type imports

## Code Style
The project uses Prettier for code formatting with configuration in [.prettierrc](mdc:.prettierrc).
